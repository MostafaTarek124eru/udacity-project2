"More EC2 instances for scaling, Larger RDS instances, Third availability zone set up in us-east-2 with VPC NAT Gateway, CloudFront, S3 Bucket, Elastic Load Balancing, Elastic Load Balancing, RDS read replica and ElasticCache",,,,,,,,
Reasoning,,,,,,,,
"Third availability zone in a second region allows for failover if the whole of the us-east-1 region goes down. Larger RDS instances improve database performance and prepare for growth of the platform over time.
